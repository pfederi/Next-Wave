What's New in Version 3.4.4:

New Features
• Clear Ship Data Cache: Manually refresh ship deployment data in Settings > Data Management
• Albis-Class Filter Settings: Enable/disable the device flip filter in Settings (enabled by default)
• Flip your device 180° in the departure view to filter for the best waves on Zürichsee (Albis-Class ships only)

Improvements
• Changed "Loading..." to "No data" for more accurate ship information display
• Improved cache handling for ship deployment data - always fetches fresh data from server
• Better troubleshooting options with manual cache clearing
