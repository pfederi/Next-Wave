## How to add a new lake or station

### Data Structure

The app uses a JSON schedule file with the following structure. Note that coordinates are required for map display:

```
{
    "lakes": [
        {
            "name": "Lake",
            "operators": [
                "Operator"
            ],
            "stations": [
                {
                    "name": "Station Name",
                    "uic_ref": "8503651",
                    "coordinates": {
                        "latitude": 47.218035,
                        "longitude": 8.776638
                    }
                },
                {
                    "name": "Station Name",
                    "uic_ref": "8503682",
                    "coordinates": {
                        "latitude": 47.218035,
                        "longitude": 8.776638
                    }
                }
            ]
        },
    ]
}
```

To find the name and especially the station ID, use the tool https://overpass-turbo.osm.ch/ 
Search for the lake on the map on the right and make it completely visible. enter the following query in the console on the left:

```
node
  [amenity=ferry_terminal]
  ({{bbox}});
out;
```

All ship stations are displayed. Clicking on the station opens a window where you can find the station ID and the name of the station. uic_name and uic_ref. These two values are entered in the JSON file.

You can check whether the station is available in the API via https://transport.opendata.ch/v1/locations?query=[uic_ref].
